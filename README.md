# Crowdsourcing-Reaction-Times
Hey  there! Do you want to help me to collect some information about how fast we an process optical and acustical signals?
It's very easy and only takes a few minutes!

## 1. Open the website
For that please go to https://wolfi3654.github.io/reimagined-octo-happiness/

## 2. Fill in the form
The most relevant here are Age and Gender.
The name is only used to differentiate different people more easily.
Don't worry. The information will only be used to corolate speed with age and gender.
The information is not used to track you in any way! The complete test is anonymous!
If you don't want to give your real name you can enter a nickname or leave it empty.
The box for gender has no restrictions!
If you want to enter your gender, please be honest! False data might ruin the project :(

## 3. Take the test
Make sure your volume is turned up/on!

First you are going to see some squared randomly appear after a while.
Just click any key like 'space' when the first square appears as fast as possible.

After that you are presented with an accoustic signal after a few while.
Just hit again your key, when the signal starts.
This also repeats a few times.

Lastly, both the square and the sound are shown/played.
Just press the key as usual as fast as possible.

After that you should be presented with your average reaction time!

## 4. Thank you!
